                <p>ICIMCS 2018 will include a number of special sessions on innovative and frontier topics and themes of
                    interest to the broad multimedia community.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Each Special Session is expected to consist of five accepted papers. To ensure high quality of the
                    contributions, all papers submitted to an approved Special Session will be reviewed through the same
                    procedure and criteria as regular papers. At least one author for each accepted paper must register
                    for
                    the conference and present the paper during the Special Session.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Each Special Session proposal should include:</p>
                <p>Title and theme of the proposed special session;</p>
                <p>Tentative list of papers, including titles, authors, affiliations, and abstract;</p>
                <p> Contact, affiliation, and bio-sketch of the organizers;</p>
                <p>Special Session organizers can submit the proposals to the Special Session Co-Chairs:</p>

                <p>Hanwang Zhang (hanwangzhang@gmail.com)</p>
                <p>Proposals will be evaluated considering the appropriateness with the conference main topics, as well
                    as</p>
                <p>the quality of the paper abstracts. Papers will be submitted to the submission system and will be</p>
                <p>subjected to the same peer review of regular papers. On approval of their proposal, the Special
                    Session</p>
                <p>organizer(s) will be responsible for soliciting papers by invitation or open call, assigning

                <p>for the special session, deciding on paper acceptance based on the received paper reviews.</p>
